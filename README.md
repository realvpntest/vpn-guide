## 🌍 What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps create a **secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet**, shielding your activity and unlocking content from around the world.

Here’s what it can do for you:

- Keeps your browsing private with strong encryption  
- Gets around geo-blocks and online censorship  
- Hides your IP, boosting anonymity  
- Protects your data on sketchy public Wi-Fi spots
