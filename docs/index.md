## Why Trust Us: 100% Real Testing

Let’s be real — a lot of VPN reviews out there are shaped by affiliate deals or sponsorships. And sure, we do use affiliate links too — that’s how we keep this project alive.

But here’s the difference:  
🧪 We **actually put each VPN through real-world tests** — no recycled content, no paid rankings.

Here’s what we dive into:

- Speed results from different countries and network setups
- How well they work on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android — even routers
- Deep looks into privacy practices, no-log claims, and encryption methods
- Streaming access tests (Netflix, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, and more)
- Full user experience: support response time, refund handling, and usability

> 💡 Our affiliate links never sway our verdicts. You choose what suits you — and every signup helps us keep delivering real, unbiased reviews.

## What is a VPN

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps create a **secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet**, shielding your activity and unlocking content from around the world.

Here’s what it can do for you:

- Keeps your browsing private with strong encryption  
- Gets around geo-blocks and online censorship  
- Hides your IP, boosting anonymity  
- Protects your data on sketchy public Wi-Fi spots
