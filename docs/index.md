## Why You Can Trust Us: 100% Real Tests — By Real People

Let’s be real — most VPN reviews out there are shaped by sponsorships or affiliate deals. And yeah, we use affiliate links too — that’s how we keep this project going **without charging you a dime**.

But here’s the difference:  
🧪 We’re **not the biggest or most polished review site** — and we’re not pretending to be. We’re actual users, testing VPNs the way *you* would: hands-on, in real conditions, without the marketing fluff.

Every review here comes from **real experience** — no PR kits, no AI-written filler, no paid placements.

Here’s what we really test:

- Speeds across countries, devices, and networks
- Performance on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS — even routers
- Privacy and no-log claims, encryption strength
- Streaming access (Netflix, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, etc.)
- The full user journey — UI, support speed, refund hassle

> 💡 Yep, we use affiliate links — but **they don’t influence our opinions**.
> You choose what works for you. And if you use our links to support us, thank you — it helps us keep testing and telling it straight.

## What is a VPN

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps create a **secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet**, shielding your activity and unlocking content from around the world.

Here’s what it can do for you:

- Keeps your browsing private with strong encryption  
- Gets around geo-blocks and online censorship  
- Hides your IP, boosting anonymity  
- Protects your data on sketchy public Wi-Fi spots
