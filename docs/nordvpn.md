## 💡 Why Is NordVPN the Best VPN?

NordVPN stands out in 2025 due to its perfect balance of **speed**, **security**, **streaming access**, and **global reliability**. Here are the key reasons why it's considered the best VPN this year:

- 📺 **Seamless Streaming**  
  NordVPN unlocks major platforms like **Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, BBC iPlayer**, and more with minimal buffering — making it ideal for entertainment enthusiasts.

- 🚀 **Superior Speeds**  
  Powered by the **NordLynx protocol** (based on WireGuard), NordVPN delivers top-tier speeds even on long-distance connections, perfect for 4K streaming, downloads, and gaming.

- 🔎 **Independently Audited**  
  Its **no-logs policy** has been verified by reputable third-party audits, proving NordVPN’s commitment to transparency and user privacy.

## ** Key Features of NordVPN in 2025**

- **🛡️ Threat Protection Pro™**  
  NordVPN’s Threat Protection Pro™ is an advanced security tool that blocks malware, intrusive ads, trackers, and phishing domains — even when you're not connected to a VPN. Certified by AV-Test and AV-Comparatives, it combines local and cloud-based detection for real-time protection, acting like a built-in antivirus.

- **🔗 Meshnet**  
  Meshnet allows users to securely connect up to 10 personal and 50 external devices through an encrypted virtual LAN, no matter where they are. It’s ideal for remote collaboration, file sharing, and even LAN gaming across continents.

- **🌐 Dark Web Monitor**  
  This feature monitors your email for credential leaks on the dark web. If any of your data is found in leaked databases, NordVPN instantly alerts you so you can act quickly and secure your accounts.

- **🔐 Double VPN & Onion Over VPN**  
  Double VPN routes your internet traffic through two VPN servers instead of one, adding an extra layer of encryption. Onion Over VPN sends traffic through the Tor network after passing through the VPN, perfect for maximum privacy and anonymity.

- **🎬 SmartPlay**  
  SmartPlay is NordVPN’s smart DNS feature that automatically unblocks geo-restricted content. It ensures seamless streaming on platforms like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, and more — without extra configuration.

- **📱 Device Compatibility**  
  NordVPN supports up to 10 simultaneous device connections and works across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, smart TVs, and routers. It also offers browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

- **🖥️ Enhanced Linux GUI**  
  In 2025, NordVPN launched a brand-new graphical user interface (GUI) for Linux, making it easier than ever for Linux users to connect, select servers, and manage settings through a sleek, visual layout.

- **🧬 Post-Quantum Encryption (PQE)**  
  NordVPN now supports post-quantum encryption (PQE) — designed to withstand the future threat of quantum computers cracking traditional encryption. This is enabled through the NordLynx protocol and available across all major platforms.

- **🛰️ NordWhisper Protocol**  
  The newly introduced NordWhisper protocol disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, improving reliability in restricted environments like airports, schools, and censorship-heavy countries. It's NordVPN’s stealth mode for hard-to-penetrate networks.

## 🎮 Is NordVPN Good for Gaming?

We ran ping tests across multiple NordVPN servers to evaluate gaming performance. Low ping is essential for competitive and real-time games, where anything under 100 ms is ideal and under 150 ms is acceptable. Here's how NordVPN performed:

### 🕹️ Ping Test Results by Region

## 🌐 NordVPN Performance in Internet-Restricted Regions

NordVPN remains one of the most dependable VPNs for users in **heavily censored regions** such as **China**, **Iran**, and the **United Arab Emirates**, thanks to its **Obfuscated Servers** and manual connection capabilities.

### 🇨🇳 Real-World Use in China

As of 2025, **NordVPN can still be used inside China**, but **manual configuration is required** due to strict firewall filtering. The default "Quick Connect" feature typically fails in this environment.

To connect successfully:

1. Enable **Obfuscated Servers** in NordVPN settings.
2. Use **OpenVPN (TCP)** protocol — this works best under DPI (deep packet inspection).
3. Manually connect to one of the recommended high-stability servers.

### 🗂️ Recommended Manual Servers

You can use the IP address or hostname below to create a custom connection profile using OpenVPN or the NordVPN CLI tool:

| Location | IP Address        | Hostname             |

### 🖼️ Screenshot: Successful Manual Connection from China

![Manual Connection Screenshot](./assets/nord/nordvpnok.webp)

---

### ✅ Summary

- Manual connection is **currently required** in regions like China.
- Recommended protocol: **OpenVPN TCP + Obfuscated Server**
- NordVPN continues to be one of the **most viable VPNs inside internet-restricted countries** in 2025.



---

### 🎯 Analysis

- **Canada Node** performed best with a **78ms ping** to Central servers, and sub-100ms to multiple U.S. regions. Ideal for North American game servers (e.g., Valorant NA, Call of Duty Warzone NA, etc.)
- **UK Node** had an average of **111–150ms**, still playable for many European MMORPGs or strategy games, though slightly laggy for FPS.
- **Japan Node** showed **high ping values (175ms–280ms)** even to nearby Asia servers like Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore — indicating suboptimal routing under NordVPN for gaming in Asia.

### ✅ Verdict

NordVPN is suitable for **casual gaming and mid-latency genres** like strategy, RPGs, and turn-based games. For **competitive FPS or eSports**, it works well in North America but may struggle in **Asia-Pacific** due to higher latency. To optimize gameplay:

- Choose servers geographically close to your game server
- Use the **NordLynx** protocol for better speed & stability
- Avoid double encryption features like Double VPN during gaming

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

NordVPN continues to set the standard for online security and privacy in 2025, offering a comprehensive suite of features designed to protect users from evolving digital threats.

### 🧬 Post-Quantum Encryption (PQE)

Anticipating future threats posed by quantum computing, NordVPN has introduced Post-Quantum Encryption across all platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and smart TVs. This advanced encryption is available when using the NordLynx protocol, NordVPN’s proprietary protocol based on WireGuard. PQE enhances long-term data security by employing complex mathematical techniques resistant to quantum decryption. Users can activate PQE via a toggle in the app’s settings. 

### 🛡️ Threat Protection Pro™

### 🧾 Independently Audited No-Logs Policy

NordVPN maintains a strict no-logs policy, ensuring that user activity is not tracked, collected, or shared. This commitment to privacy has been independently verified through multiple audits by reputable firms, including PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Switzerland and Deloitte, confirming NordVPN's adherence to its no-logs claims. 

### 🧠 RAM-Only Servers

All NordVPN servers operate on RAM-only infrastructure, meaning no data is stored on physical hard drives. This ensures that all information is wiped clean with every server reboot, providing an additional layer of security and minimizing the risk of data retention.

### 🧅 Advanced Privacy Features

- **Double VPN**: Routes your connection through two servers for double encryption, enhancing anonymity.
- **Onion Over VPN**: Combines the privacy benefits of The Onion Router (Tor) with VPN tunneling for maximum security.
- **Obfuscated Servers**: Conceals VPN traffic to appear as regular internet traffic, helping bypass network restrictions and VPN blocks.

### 🌐 Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction

Based in Panama, NordVPN operates outside the jurisdiction of the 5/9/14 Eyes alliances. Panama has no mandatory data retention laws, allowing NordVPN to uphold its strict no-logs policy without legal obligations to store user data.
