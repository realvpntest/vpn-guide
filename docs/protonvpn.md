## Introduction to Proton VPN

### Why VPNs Are Essential in 2025
In 2025, concerns over digital surveillance, data mining, and censorship have reached unprecedented levels. Whether you're accessing a coffee shop’s Wi-Fi or working remotely, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. VPNs provide encrypted tunnels for your internet traffic, masking your IP address and shielding your online activity from ISPs, hackers, and prying eyes.

### Proton VPN’s Mission and Background
Proton VPN was developed by the scientists and engineers behind Proton Mail—the world’s largest secure email service. Headquartered in Switzerland, Proton VPN benefits from some of the strongest privacy laws globally. Their mission is to make privacy and security accessible to all, offering a free VPN plan that doesn’t compromise on user rights or data safety.

## Core Security Features of Proton VPN

### Swiss Jurisdiction and Privacy Laws
Operating under Swiss law gives Proton VPN a significant advantage in terms of privacy. Switzerland is outside EU and US jurisdictions, meaning Proton VPN is not legally required to comply with invasive data-sharing agreements. This legal environment is ideal for anyone concerned about government surveillance.

### No-Logs Policy Explained
Proton VPN adheres strictly to a verified no-logs policy. This means they do not collect or retain metadata, session timestamps, IP addresses, or browsing activity. Even if law enforcement requested user data, there would be nothing to provide—a significant trust signal for privacy-conscious users.

### Open Source Transparency
Unlike many competitors, Proton VPN’s apps are open source and audited by independent security experts. This transparency allows users and professionals to inspect the code themselves and ensures there are no hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors.

### Secure Core Architecture
Proton VPN's unique Secure Core feature routes your traffic through multiple hardened servers before exiting to the internet. This extra layer of protection is especially valuable when connecting from high-risk locations or countries with active surveillance regimes.

## Proton VPN Free Plan Deep Dive

### Unlimited Data and Speed
Proton VPN is one of the few VPN providers offering **unlimited data** on its free plan. While speeds are not as fast as the paid tiers, the connection remains stable and sufficient for browsing, emailing, and light video consumption—no throttling or daily caps involved.

### Server Access and Country Availability
Free users can access servers in three countries: the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. While limited compared to paid plans, these locations cover key regions in North America, Europe, and Asia, allowing users to bypass basic geo-restrictions.

### Limitations of the Free Plan
The free plan is designed for basic security, not for streaming or torrenting. It supports only one device connection, lacks access to Secure Core servers, and cannot unblock major streaming platforms. However, these restrictions are fair trade-offs for a high-quality zero-cost VPN service.

### Who Should Use the Free Plan?
The free plan is perfect for students, journalists, travelers, and anyone who needs strong privacy on a budget. It’s also a great option for those who want to evaluate the service before committing to a paid subscription.
