## 🚀 Speed & Performance: Real-World Testing <a id="speed"></a>

PureVPN delivers decent speed results, especially on nearby servers. However, performance consistency may vary depending on distance and server load. Here's what our real-world testing revealed:

### 🇨🇦 Canada Server - Toronto
![PureVPN Canada Speed Test](./assets/purevpn/caspeed.webp)

- **Ping**: 27 ms
- **Download Speed**: 168.92 Mbps
- **Upload Speed**: 405.23 Mbps

Performance on the Canadian server (Toronto) is excellent. With low latency and strong bandwidth, it's well-suited for HD streaming, video conferencing, and even competitive online gaming.

- **Download Speed**: 156.53 Mbps
- **Upload Speed**: 31.68 Mbps

On the UK server (Manchester), latency increases due to distance, but download speeds remain solid. This server is reliable for accessing UK-specific services like BBC iPlayer and UK Netflix.

### 🌐 Multi-Region Ping Comparison
![PureVPN Ping Test Comparison](./assets/purevpn/cagame.webp)

Ping tests show favorable latency to North American regions such as **Virginia (80 ms)**, **Ohio (93 ms)**, and **Central Canada (72 ms)** — all within acceptable ranges for smooth browsing and streaming. However, latency spikes above **160 ms** to West Coast U.S. (California, Oregon) and over **260 ms** in Europe (London, Paris, Zurich) may impact performance for latency-sensitive tasks like gaming.

### ✅ Verdict

PureVPN shows **strong speed on local and North American servers**, with **reliable streaming** performance and **good upload capacity**. However, **latency increases on distant servers**, which may affect real-time apps like online games or VoIP.

If you're primarily targeting **North American content or need solid upload performance**, PureVPN is a capable choice. For **globally consistent low-latency needs**, especially in Asia or Europe, top-tier competitors may provide more stability.
