- No manual configuration needed — the feature activates on its own in restricted environments
- Provides a more dependable connection when standard VPN servers struggle

---

### ✅ Real-World Test: Surfshark in China

Our hands-on testing confirmed Surfshark is **one of the few VPNs still functioning reliably behind China’s Great Firewall**:

- Connected successfully to servers in **Hong Kong**, **Japan**, **Singapore**, and the **United States**
- Best results came from pairing **WireGuard** with **NoBorders Mode**
- You might need a few attempts to connect, but once you're in, the connection holds steady
